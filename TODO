1. TODO:

- Makes ansible-doc.vim behaves like pydoc.vim, vim-perldoc, vim-superman,
letting users view documentation for Ansible's modules inside Vim.

- The plugin has no colorization of output for Bash/Zsh (in other words, just
jump straight into Vim when viewing the ansible-doc, because ansible-doc is
specifically used by programmers, so just having Vim-viewing mode instead of
both Bash/Zsh and Vim-viewing makes more sense than vim-stardict)

- When issuing "ansibledoc" (no hyphen) on the shell (Bash/Zsh), the doc is
opened inside Vim. User can do alias "ansible-doc"="ansibledoc" to make all
ansible-doc command's results opened in Vim.

- The plugin supports all commands of ansible-doc, including:
+ AnsibleDocList (ansible-doc --list)
+ AnsibleDocSnippet (ansible-doc --snippet)

+ let g:ansible_module_path=...
+ :AnsibleDoc when pressing Tab will present suggestion/autocompletion of module
names

- The plugin highlights the search term of the users when showing the
ansible-doc

- The plugin takes advantage of yaml highlighting from vim-ansible-yaml, and
thus dependent on vim-ansible-yaml (we will have to source vim-ansible-yaml
somehow and/or set filetype=ansible for the doc)

- Make output of ansible-doc snippet adheres to the textwidth settings of the
user (may have to use less?)


2. DONE:

- The plugin is written purely in VimScript

- Also allows viewing ansible-doc for word under cursor

- The plugin supports all commands of ansible-doc, including:
+ AnsibleDocCursor looks for ansible-doc of the word under the cursor
